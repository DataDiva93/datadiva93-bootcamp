Hey everyone, and welcome to Week 4 of the DataDiva Bootcamp!

This week weâ€™re diving into SQL â€” the language of data.

SQL is used in almost every job that works with data. Whether 
you're an analyst, engineer, or data scientist, it helps you 
pull answers directly from databases.

In this lab, youâ€™ll use a real employee dataset to write SELECT 
statements, filter data, sort results, and calculate averages.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to explore real 
datasets with confidence â€” and that's a superpower in tech.

Letâ€™s jump in and write some queries together ðŸ’œ
