Hey divas and devs 
 â€” welcome to the final week of the DataDiva 
Bootcamp!

This is it. The capstone project. Your chance to build something 
real that reflects your skills, your passion, and your future.

Youâ€™ve completed 8 full modules across the stack â€” from Git and 
Python to Power BI and Tableau.

Now itâ€™s time to choose your own adventure.

What will you build?  
A dashboard? A web app? A machine learning project?  
Whatever you choose, make it yours. Show the world what youâ€™ve 
got.

And donâ€™t forget â€” include a README, make it clean, and tell 
your story.  
Youâ€™ve come so far. Letâ€™s finish strong ðŸ’œ
