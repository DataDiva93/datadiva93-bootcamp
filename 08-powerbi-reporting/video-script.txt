Hey everyone, and welcome to Week 8 of the DataDiva Bootcamp!

Today, weâ€™re diving into Power BI â€” Microsoftâ€™s 
industry-standard tool for creating powerful, interactive 
dashboards.

Youâ€™ll load real sales data, create visualizations, add filters, 
and publish your work to the Power BI service.

Weâ€™ll cover calculated columns, slicers, and layout tips so your 
dashboard is clear and insightful.

By the end of this module, youâ€™ll be able to take raw data and 
turn it into a dashboard you can present to any business team.

Letâ€™s get into Power BI and bring your data to life ðŸ’œ
