Hey everyone, and welcome to Week 6 of the DataDiva Bootcamp!

This week, weâ€™re diving into Excel â€” one of the most essential 
tools for analysts and data professionals.

Youâ€™ll learn how to calculate total sales, create pivot tables, 
and visualize your insights with clean, clear dashboards.

Weâ€™ll use formulas, charts, and filters to build a real KPI 
dashboard that you could use in a business setting.

By the end of this module, youâ€™ll be able to explore and present 
data visually â€” and thatâ€™s a skill every employer looks for.

Letâ€™s jump into Excel and build together ðŸ’œ
