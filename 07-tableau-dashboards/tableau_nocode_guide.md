## 🔹 Step 1: Load Your Data

1. Open Tableau  
2. Connect to your file: `project/sales_data.csv`  
3. Click "Sheet 1" to begin

## 🔹 Step 2: Create Your First Chart

**Goal:** Show Revenue by Region

1. Drag `Region` to Rows  
2. Drag `Units Sold` to Columns  
3. Drag `Price` to Columns (next to Units Sold)  
4. Click `Analysis > Create Calculated Field`:  
   Name it **Revenue** → Formula: `[Units Sold] * [Price]`  
5. Replace existing values with `Revenue`

✨ Boom — you have a revenue by region bar chart!

## 🔹 Step 3: Make a Line Chart (Revenue Over Time)

1. Open `Sheet 2`  
2. Drag `Date` to Columns  
3. Drag `Revenue` to Rows  
4. Change chart type to **Line**

1. Open `Sheet 3`  
2. Drag `Product` to Color  
3. Drag `Revenue` to Angle

## 🎯 Best Practices for No-Code Dashboards

- Use **clear chart titles** (not just “Sheet 1”)  
- Add **hover tooltips** for context  
- Limit filters to key views  
- Start simple — iterate later  
- Tell a clear story: What, Where, Why?

---

## ✅ Done!

You just built a clean, powerful dashboard without writing a 
line of code.

This is how analysts work fast, iterate quickly, and share 
insights that drive real business decisions 💜
