Hey everyone, and welcome to Week 7 of the DataDiva Bootcamp!

This week, weâ€™re diving into Tableau â€” one of the most powerful 
tools for visualizing data and building dashboards.

Youâ€™ll load a real dataset, create calculated fields, and build 
visual charts to show revenue trends, regional performance, and 
product share.

Weâ€™ll then combine all that into a clean, professional dashboard 
that looks great and tells a clear story.

Tableau is used by analysts, marketers, execs â€” and now you!  
Letâ€™s go from rows and columns to insights and action ðŸ’œ
