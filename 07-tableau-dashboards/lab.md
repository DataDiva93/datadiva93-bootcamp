# Lab: Tableau Dashboards – Visual Analytics

## Goal:
Use Tableau to explore sales data, uncover trends, and build an 
interactive dashboard.

---

## Step 1: Load the Dataset

Open Tableau and import `sales_data.csv` from the `project/` 
folder.

Preview the data: Order ID, Region, Product, Units Sold, Price, 
Date

---

## Step 2: Create Calculated Fields

Create a new field:

- **Revenue** = Units Sold * Price

Use this to measure performance over time and by category.

---

## Step 3: Build Visualizations

📊 Sheet 1: Revenue by Region (Bar Chart)  
📈 Sheet 2: Revenue Over Time (Line Chart)  
🥧 Sheet 3: Product Share (Pie Chart)

Add labels, sort by highest to lowest, and format for 
readability.

---

## Step 4: Build the Dashboard

Click the “New Dashboard” icon

- Drag all 3 sheets into the canvas  
- Arrange visually: top (time), middle (region), right (product)  
- Add a title and filters (e.g. by Region or Product)

---

## Step 5: Stretch Goals

- Add filters to control what’s shown  
- Use highlight actions or drill-downs  
- Publish to Tableau Public and share your link

---

## ✅ Done!

You just built a professional Tableau dashboard that turns raw 
data into decisions. 📊💜
