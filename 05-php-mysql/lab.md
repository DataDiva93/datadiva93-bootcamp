# Lab: Build a Dynamic Blog with PHP + MySQL

## Goal:
Use PHP to fetch and display blog posts from a MySQL database.

---

## Step 1: Set Up

Use a local dev tool like XAMPP or MAMP to run PHP + MySQL.

Inside your project folder, create:
- `index.php` for the blog logic
- `style.css` for basic design
- `blog.sql` to set up the database

---

## Step 2: Create the Database

Run `blog.sql` in phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench:

CREATE DATABASE blog;
USE blog;

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  content TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO posts (title, content) VALUES
('First Post', 'Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.'),
('Second Post', 'PHP and MySQL are powerful together.'),
('Third Post', 'Soon, Iâ€™ll connect this to a real frontend.');

---

## Step 3: Write PHP to Query Posts

In `index.php`, connect to the database and show each post on 
the page.

---

## Step 4: Stretch Goals

- Style the page with CSS  
- Add a form to insert new posts  
- Show only the 5 most recent posts

---

## âœ… Done!

You just built a real dynamic web app â€” where content lives in a 
database and appears on your page ðŸ’œ
