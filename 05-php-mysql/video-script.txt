Hey everyone, and welcome to Week 5 of the DataDiva Bootcamp!

Today weâ€™re building our first full-stack project: a simple blog 
using PHP and MySQL.

Youâ€™ll write SQL to create a posts table, then use PHP to 
connect to that database and display each post on your webpage.

This is how most dynamic websites work â€” data lives in a 
database, and your code decides how and when to show it.

By the end of this module, youâ€™ll have a real dynamic website 
where the content lives in a database and updates live on the 
page.

Letâ€™s build it together ðŸ’œ
