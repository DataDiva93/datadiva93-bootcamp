Hey everyone, and welcome to Week 3 of the DataDiva Bootcamp!

This week, weâ€™re building a real interactive web app using 
JavaScript.

Youâ€™ll create a simple To-Do List where users can type a task 
and add it to a list. Itâ€™s your first intro to how HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript all work together.

Weâ€™ll walk through the structure of the page, how to style it, 
and how to use JavaScript to make it respond to user input.

By the end of this module, youâ€™ll have your own working app â€” 
and the skills to make more!

Letâ€™s dive in ðŸ’œ
